## Check the files
1. Check that you have received the file called SimpleShell.jar
2. If you are reading this, you have README.md file too

---

## Run the executable

---

### Operating System
I recommend the following operating systems:
* Linux Fedora
* Linux Ubuntu

This app running under other OS are not supporting.

---
### Open the application
* Open the app called "Terminal", and search the directory where you have the SimpleShell.jar
* Then, run the SimpleShell using the command: 
```
java -jar SimpleShell.jar
```

### Application commands
SimpleShell supports the major part of "standard" commands that you may use with the linux shell.
Some of this are:
* ls: lists the files in the current directory
* pwd: prints the working directory
* cal: shows the current month calendar
* man: prints the manual of any installed app

Also, the app includes "special" commands like:
1.  cd: changes the directory
```
